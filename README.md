Hello, I'm Ken. Before I knew what github or stackoverflow was, I was pursuing healthcare and studying for the PCAT Exam. During the later portion of the pandemic I was introduced to web development, and have spent this summer working on the curriculum provided by the Odin Project. The plan is to complete the curriculum and post my progress on here. I'm a bit more CSS/ design oriented so it might take longer than expected but I am looking forward to looking back and seeing the progression.

Currently familiar with:
HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

Currently working on:
Odin Project: Calculator.
